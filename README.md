# KQL For Security Analystis
This repository is meant to provide help in understanding and using Microsoft's language (KQL) for getting insights and finding valueable information regarding defenses using MS security stack. This is a humble effort to explain KQL language, and how it relates to Microsoft cloud (aka MS Azure) world. There are a number of other tutorials and sample queries that can be used as reference.

My idea is to try to explain how I ended up solving the problems I am encountering during my journey as an Azure Sentinel guy, while using KQL to make Microsoft Sentinel security related use cases.

**Prerequisites**:
To be able to fully exploit this knowledge base, the readers are encouraged to have a basic understanding of how databases work as well as basic scripting programming skills.

**The approach**:

I want to drive the teaching approach based on use-cases. So that the readers can apply it right away on their real world scenarios, while learning this powerful language of KQL. The idea is to move along while creating material for directly using it  for establishing uses-cases. It is an effort to try to help security analysts in learning the language as well as putting it into action as soon as possible.

The idea is to start with the basic KQL, explaining what purpose it serves, how it relates to Microsoft services in Azure as a whole, and some basic optimizing rules so that we do not overwhelm the systems.


**Assumptions:**
<p> It is assumed that you have basic understanding of what a scripting language is, and what purpose it serves. You do not need to have any prior knowledge of KQL as a querying language. </p>
