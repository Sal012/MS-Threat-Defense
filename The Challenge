According to the survey that Microsoft carry it out, people who are at the beginning stage off KQL usually struggle with the fact that they know the commands and they know the keywords to some extent but they do not know how to apply those commands and those keywords in the context that they understand the languages applicability. secondly most of the people find the available resources around learning KQL to be focused on what keywords are available, but not necessarily how to tweak or use them in the context in the most efficient way. 
some people at the beginning stage (according to the survey) have also mentioned that they struggle to find KQL learning material that is focused on using Microsoft Sentinel and building use cases around it. these are the two challenges that I also struggled with, which I hope for the community to be easier for anybody going through it the next time.
